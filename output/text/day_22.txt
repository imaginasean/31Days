Welcome to Day 22 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Production Debugging: When It's On Fire.

Picture the worst debugging scenario. Something’s broken in production. You can’t add console dot log and redeploy. You can’t attach a debugger. You can’t reproduce it locally because you don’t know what’s causing it.

All you have is what’s already there: logs, error messages, metrics if you were smart enough to add them.

This is where AI earns its keep. Not because it has magic access to your systems, but because it’s good at exactly the thing you need: analyzing information and finding patterns. You paste in logs, stack traces, error messages. AI spots the anomaly you’d miss after staring at the screen for an hour.

The Incident Response Prompt

When things are on fire, start here:

Showing a structured prompt template for AI-assisted incident triage, with placeholders for error details, symptoms, recent changes, and system architecture.

Keep it short. You’re in a hurry.

Stack Trace Analysis Under Pressure

When you have a stack trace:

Showing a prompt template for quickly analyzing production errors by pasting a stack trace and requesting a structured breakdown of the error source and likely cause.

No elaborate explanations needed. You need direction, not education.

Log Pattern Recognition

When you have logs but can’t see the pattern:

Showing a prompt template for analyzing production logs to identify when a problem started, what changed, and any patterns in errors.

AI can spot patterns in logs faster than scrolling through them manually.

The Correlation Prompt

When multiple things seem broken:

Showing a debugging prompt template that lists multiple failure symptoms and recent changes, then asks an AI to identify a common root cause.

Often multiple symptoms have one root cause. AI helps find the connection.

Quick Mitigation Strategies

When you need to stop the bleeding:

Showing a prompt template for getting AI help during production incidents, requesting ranked mitigation options based on speed, risk, and effectiveness.

Sometimes the right answer is a workaround that buys you time.

Database Issue Diagnosis

Database problems need specific analysis:

Showing a troubleshooting template for diagnosing production database issues, with placeholders for symptoms, metrics, recent changes, and questions to ask.

The Rollback Decision

When you’re not sure whether to rollback:

Showing a prompt template for getting AI help deciding whether to rollback a deployment, with placeholders for the problem, recent changes, and potential risks.

Post-Incident Analysis Prompt

After the fire is out:

Showing a prompt template for analyzing system incidents that asks for a timeline, impact assessment, root cause analysis, and action items.

The “I Have No Idea” Prompt

Sometimes you’re truly stuck:

Showing a debugging prompt template for getting help when stuck on a production issue, with placeholders for symptoms, what's been ruled out, and attempted fixes.

Admitting you’re stuck is the first step to getting unstuck.

Information Gathering Under Pressure

When you need to collect more data quickly:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to generate debugging commands for a specified system and problem, covering resources, processes, logs, and connectivity.

The Customer Impact Prompt

When you need to communicate:

Showing a prompt template for generating customer-facing status updates about technical incidents, with placeholders for incident details and guidelines for tone.

Communication matters during incidents. AI can help you write clearly when you’re stressed.

Building Your Incident Playbook

After enough incidents, you have patterns. Document them:

Showing a prompt template for generating an incident response playbook, with placeholders for incident types and a structured outline requesting symptoms, diagnostic steps, causes, and resolution procedures.

Then when an incident happens, you have a starting point.

What AI Can’t Do in Incidents

AI can’t:

Access your systems

See your actual metrics

Know your specific architecture

Make decisions for you

Tell you what changed recently

Know your organizational context

You still need to:

Gather the information

Run the commands

Make the judgment calls

Communicate with stakeholders

Execute the fixes

AI is your thinking partner, not your incident commander.

The Incident Checklist

Keep this handy:

Showing a checklist for incident response with steps from acknowledgment through resolution and post-mortem scheduling.

Tomorrow

Incidents often come from edge cases you didn’t anticipate. Tomorrow I’ll show you how to use AI to find edge cases before they find you. Proactive problem-finding instead of reactive firefighting.

Try This Today

Think about your last production incident.

What information did you have?

What questions did you need answered?

How would you have prompted AI?

Having prompts ready before incidents happen means you can move faster when they do.

That's it for Day 22. Join us tomorrow for Day 23. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
