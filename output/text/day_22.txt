==================================================

Welcome to Day 22 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Production Debugging: When It's On Fire.

Picture the worst debugging scenario. Something’s broken in production. You can’t add console dot log and redeploy. You can’t attach a debugger. You can’t reproduce it locally because you don’t know what’s causing it.

All you have is what’s already there: logs, error messages, metrics if you were smart enough to add them.

This is where AI earns its keep. Not because it has magic access to your systems, but because it’s good at exactly the thing you need: analyzing information and finding patterns. You paste in logs, stack traces, error messages. AI spots the anomaly you’d miss after staring at the screen for an hour.

The Incident Response Prompt

When things are on fire, start here:

A code example with 19 lines - see the article for details.

Keep it short. You’re in a hurry.

Stack Trace Analysis Under Pressure

When you have a stack trace:

A code example with 9 lines - see the article for details.

No elaborate explanations needed. You need direction, not education.

Log Pattern Recognition

When you have logs but can’t see the pattern:

A code example with 11 lines - see the article for details.

AI can spot patterns in logs faster than scrolling through them manually.

The Correlation Prompt

When multiple things seem broken:

A code example with 11 lines - see the article for details.

Often multiple symptoms have one root cause. AI helps find the connection.

Quick Mitigation Strategies

When you need to stop the bleeding:

A code example with 12 lines - see the article for details.

Sometimes the right answer is a workaround that buys you time.

Database Issue Diagnosis

Database problems need specific analysis:

A code example with 16 lines - see the article for details.

The Rollback Decision

When you’re not sure whether to rollback:

A code example with 12 lines - see the article for details.

Post-Incident Analysis Prompt

After the fire is out:

A code example with 16 lines - see the article for details.

The “I Have No Idea” Prompt

Sometimes you’re truly stuck:

A code example with 10 lines - see the article for details.

Admitting you’re stuck is the first step to getting unstuck.

Information Gathering Under Pressure

When you need to collect more data quickly:

A code example with 14 lines - see the article for details.

The Customer Impact Prompt

When you need to communicate:

A code example with 12 lines - see the article for details.

Communication matters during incidents. AI can help you write clearly when you’re stressed.

Building Your Incident Playbook

After enough incidents, you have patterns. Document them:

A code example with 14 lines - see the article for details.

Then when an incident happens, you have a starting point.

What AI Can’t Do in Incidents

AI can’t:

Access your systems

See your actual metrics

Know your specific architecture

Make decisions for you

Tell you what changed recently

Know your organizational context

You still need to:

Gather the information

Run the commands

Make the judgment calls

Communicate with stakeholders

Execute the fixes

AI is your thinking partner, not your incident commander.

The Incident Checklist

Keep this handy:

A code example with 11 lines - see the article for details.

Tomorrow

Incidents often come from edge cases you didn’t anticipate. Tomorrow I’ll show you how to use AI to find edge cases before they find you. Proactive problem-finding instead of reactive firefighting.

Try This Today

Think about your last production incident.

What information did you have?

What questions did you need answered?

How would you have prompted AI?

Having prompts ready before incidents happen means you can move faster when they do.

That's it for Day 22. Join us tomorrow for Day 23. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
