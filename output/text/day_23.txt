Welcome to Day 23 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Asking AI for Edge Cases You'd Never Think Of.

The bug report said it all: “Username displays as undefined undefined.”

Somewhere in my code, I’d assumed every user had a first name and last name. Most do. But one user had only entered an email. No name at all. My concatenation code produced “undefined undefined” and displayed it proudly.

I thought about names. I didn’t think about missing names.

This is the edge case problem. You build for what you expect. You break on what you don’t expect. And there’s always something you don’t expect.

AI has seen millions of edge cases. When you ask it what could break your code, it pulls from all of them. It thinks of the empty strings, the null values, the Unicode characters, the leap years, the timezone boundaries. The things you forget because you’re focused on making it work.

The Edge Case Generation Prompt

For any function:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to generate edge cases for testing code, with a checklist covering null inputs, boundary values, type issues, unicode, concurrency, and other potential failure scenarios.

A Real Edge Case Analysis

Here’s a simple function:

Showing a TypeScript function that formats a user's full name by combining their first and last name.

AI’s edge case analysis:

Empty slash Missing Values:

user.firstName is undefined leads to “undefined Smith”

user.lastName is undefined leads to “John undefined”

Both undefined leads to “undefined undefined”

Empty strings leads to “ “ (just a space)

Whitespace only leads to “ “ (multiple spaces)

Unicode and Special Characters:

Name contains emoji leads to “John 🚀” (might display wrong)

Right-to-left characters leads to Display order issues

Very long names leads to UI overflow

Names with quotes leads to “John O’Brien” (apostrophe might cause issues in certain contexts)

Names with HTML leads to <script>alert()</script> (XSS if not escaped)

Type Issues:

user is null leads to TypeError

user is undefined leads to TypeError

firstName is a number leads to “123 Smith” (type coercion)

Edge Cases in Valid Data:

Single word name (like “Madonna”) leads to Unclear how to handle

Hyphenated names leads to “Mary Jane Watson-Parker”

Multiple middle names leads to Not handled

Prefixes slash suffixes leads to “Dr. John Smith Jr.”

A better implementation:

Showing a TypeScript function that formats a user's display name from their first and last name, falling back to email or "Unknown User" if unavailable.

The Input Validation Prompt

For API endpoints:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to generate comprehensive test cases for API input validation, covering categories like missing fields, wrong types, injection attempts, and edge cases.

The State Machine Prompt

For features with multiple states:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to analyze state transitions for a feature and identify invalid states, edge cases, and potential failure scenarios.

Time and Date Edge Cases

Time is always harder than you think:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to analyze code for time-related edge cases, listing ten categories including timezone boundaries, daylight saving time, and the Unix timestamp overflow problem.

Concurrency Edge Cases

When multiple things happen at once:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to analyze code for concurrency issues, listing specific scenarios like race conditions, deadlocks, and lost updates to check for.

The Failure Mode Prompt

For integrations and external dependencies:

Showing a prompt template that systematically asks developers to analyze failure modes for each dependency, covering scenarios like downtime, slow responses, errors, and partial data.

The User Behavior Prompt

Users do unexpected things:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to analyze potential edge cases and unexpected user behaviors that could break a specific feature.

The Data Volume Prompt

Scale reveals edge cases:

Showing a prompt template for analyzing system scalability, listing common bottlenecks like database queries, API limits, and memory constraints at various growth multipliers.

Building Edge Cases Into Your Workflow

Don’t wait until production. Ask for edge cases:

During design: “What inputs could break this?” During implementation: “What am I not handling?” During review: “What edge cases should tests cover?” During testing: “What else should I test?”

Make edge case thinking habitual.

The Edge Case Checklist

For any feature:

Showing a checklist of edge cases and error conditions to consider when testing, including null values, boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and failure scenarios.

Tomorrow

You’ve found the edge cases. Now you need to deploy the fixes. Deployment is scary, especially with AI-generated code. Tomorrow I’ll show you how to use AI to generate deployment automation: migrations, rollback scripts, and runbooks.

Try This Today

Take a feature you built recently

Run the edge case generation prompt

Pick one edge case you didn’t handle

Fix it

There’s always at least one. Usually there are ten. Find them before your users do.

That's it for Day 23. Join us tomorrow for Day 24. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
