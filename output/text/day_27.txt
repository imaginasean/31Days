Welcome to Day 27 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Building Your Prompt Library: Capture What Works.

I wrote the same prompt three times last week.

Each time I needed to generate tests, I wrote a new prompt from scratch. Each time it was slightly different. Each time I forgot something the previous version had.

This is inefficient. When you find a prompt that works, save it. Categorize it. Reuse it. Stop reinventing prompts every time you need to do the same kind of task.

Your prompt library is an investment. Build it once, benefit forever.

What Goes in a Prompt Library

Prompts that:

You use more than once

Took time to get right

Work consistently well

Apply to common tasks

Don’t save:

One-off prompts for unique situations

Prompts that didn’t work

Prompts that are just your project context

Get the Starter Kit

I’ve created a prompt library starter kit you can use right now:

Or browse the templates directly: examples slash prompt-library

Library Structure

I organize by task type:

A code example with 23 lines - see the article for details.

Each file contains one prompt template with placeholders, an example, and variations.

Prompt Template Format

Each saved prompt should have:

A code example with 6 lines - see the article for details.

Generate a REST API endpoint.

Context:

Framework: {framework}

Database: {database}

Auth: {auth_method}

Endpoint:

Method: {method}

Path: {path}

Purpose: {purpose}

Request body:

{request_schema}

Response:

{response_schema}

Include:

Input validation

Error handling

Telemetry

Tests

Follow the patterns in {reference_file}.

A code example with 7 lines - see the article for details.

Building Your Library Incrementally

Don’t create everything at once. Build as you go:

Write a prompt for your current task

It works well and produces good output

Extract the template by replacing specifics with placeholders

Save it in the appropriate category

Next time , use the template instead of starting from scratch

My Core Prompts

Here are the prompts I use most often:

Feature Generation

A code example with 24 lines - see the article for details.

Test Generation

A code example with 18 lines - see the article for details.

Code Review

A code example with 16 lines - see the article for details.

Debug

A code example with 16 lines - see the article for details.

Parameterizing Prompts

Good templates have clear placeholders:

Bad:

A code example with 2 lines - see the article for details.

Good:

A code example with 8 lines - see the article for details.

Clear placeholders remind you what to fill in.

Prompt Composition

Complex tasks combine multiple prompts:

A code example with 27 lines - see the article for details.

Version Controlling Your Prompts

Your prompts are code. Version control them:

Store in your repo or a dedicated prompts repo

Commit changes with messages explaining improvements

Tag versions that work well

Branch for experiments

Sharing With Your Team

Prompt libraries multiply when shared:

Central repo with team prompts

Contributing guidelines for adding new prompts

Review process for quality control

Documentation on when to use what

A team prompt library means everyone benefits from anyone’s discoveries.

Evolving Your Prompts

Prompts need maintenance:

A code example with 13 lines - see the article for details.

Track why prompts change. Learn from what didn’t work.

The Prompt Development Loop

Use a prompt

Evaluate the output

Identify what was missing or wrong

Update the prompt

Repeat

Your prompts should get better over time.

Quick Access

Make your prompts easy to use:

Keyboard shortcuts to insert templates

Snippets in your editor

CLI tool to cat prompts

Browser bookmarks if using web UI

Friction kills reuse. Make it effortless.

Tomorrow

You have prompts that work. You have a library. But how do you know AI is actually helping? Tomorrow I’ll cover measuring what matters: is AI making you faster, or just making you feel faster?

Try This Today

Think of a prompt you’ve written multiple times

Extract it into a template

Save it somewhere you’ll find it

Use the template next time

Start with one prompt. Add more as you encounter them. In a month, you’ll have a library that saves you real time.

That's it for Day 27. Join us tomorrow for Day 28. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
