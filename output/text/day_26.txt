==================================================

Welcome to Day 26 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Working Across Multiple Services With AI.

The feature touched everything.

Frontend components. Backend API endpoints. Database schema. Redis caching. Third-party integrations. A simple “add to wishlist” feature required changes in six different places.

AI is great at generating code for one thing at a time. But real features aren’t one thing. They’re systems of things that need to work together. Types that need to match. Contracts that need to align. Changes that need to happen in the right order.

This is where vibe coding gets tricky. You’re not just prompting for code. You’re orchestrating changes across a system.

The Multi-Service Planning Prompt

Start with the big picture:

Showing a prompt template for planning a feature across multiple services, asking an AI to help identify changes, dependencies, contracts, deployment order, and potential risks.

The Contract-First Approach

Define the interfaces before the implementations:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to generate API contracts, database schemas, TypeScript interfaces, and event schemas for a feature to serve as a shared source of truth.

Example output:

Showing TypeScript interfaces defining API contracts, database schema, and event types for a wishlist feature.

Now every service implementation references these contracts.

The Backend Implementation Prompt

With contracts defined:

Showing a prompt template that instructs an AI to generate a complete backend feature implementation including API endpoints, service logic, database queries, validation, and tests based on provided contracts and existing codebase patterns.

The Frontend Implementation Prompt

Similarly for frontend:

Showing a prompt template that instructs an AI to generate frontend code including API clients, React components, state management, and tests based on provided specifications.

The Database Migration Prompt

For schema changes:

Showing a prompt template for generating database migrations that asks the AI to consider downtime, existing data, indexes, and rollback procedures.

Keeping Types in Sync

When types exist in multiple places:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to compare type definitions across backend, frontend, and database layers to identify mismatches and recommend a single source of truth strategy.

The Integration Test Prompt

Testing across services:

Showing a prompt template that requests integration tests for a cross-service feature, listing the data flow steps and specific test scenarios to cover.

The Dependency Order Prompt

When changes must happen in sequence:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to help determine deployment order for multiple services given specific changes and constraints.

The Backward Compatibility Prompt

When you can’t deploy everything at once:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to generate backward-compatible code for an API migration, including the current and desired contracts.

Coordinating Prompts Across Files

When one prompt needs to inform another:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to generate a frontend component that integrates with previously defined API endpoints and database schema.

The System Context Document

For complex features, create a context document:

Showing a feature specification template for a wishlist feature, outlining affected services, implementation checklist, and sections for contracts and open questions.

Reference this document in every prompt for consistent context.

The Cross-Service Debug Prompt

When something isn’t working across services:

Showing a prompt template for debugging cross-service issues, with placeholders for expected versus actual behavior and logs from frontend, backend, and database.

The Feature Flag Prompt

For gradual cross-service rollout:

Showing a prompt template for designing a gradual feature rollout across multiple services with synchronized feature flags and staged percentages.

Tomorrow

You’ve been writing a lot of prompts. Some work great. Some don’t. Tomorrow I’ll show you how to build a prompt library: capturing what works, organizing by task type, and never having to write the same prompt twice.

Try This Today

Think of a feature that spans multiple services

Write out the contracts first (API shapes, types, schemas)

Use those contracts in prompts for each service

Starting with contracts forces you to think about the interfaces between services before you think about implementations. AI can help you maintain consistency across services, but only if you give it a consistent source of truth.

That's it for Day 26. Join us tomorrow for Day 27. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
