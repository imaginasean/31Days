==================================================

Welcome to Day 25 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Refactoring AI Code: From Working to Maintainable.

The feature worked perfectly. The code was a mess.

AI had generated 400 lines in a single file. Functions that did three things. Variables named data , result , temp . No comments explaining the non-obvious parts. It worked, but I dreaded having to modify it later.

This is the AI code paradox. The faster you ship, the more you accumulate code that’s hard to maintain. AI optimizes for “make it work,” not “make it understandable.”

But here’s the thing: AI is also good at refactoring. The same tool that created the mess can help clean it up. You just have to ask.

The Code Smell Detection Prompt

Start by identifying problems:

A code example with 22 lines - see the article for details.

The Incremental Refactoring Prompt

Don’t refactor everything at once. Go step by step:

A code example with 13 lines - see the article for details.

The Function Extraction Prompt

When functions do too much:

A code example with 15 lines - see the article for details.

A Real Refactoring Session

Here’s code AI generated for handling a card trade:

A code example with 43 lines - see the article for details.

After refactoring:

A code example with 74 lines - see the article for details.

The refactored version is longer but:

Each function has one job

Functions are testable independently

Error types are specific

The flow is easy to follow

Changes are isolated

The Naming Improvement Prompt

When names are unclear:

A code example with 16 lines - see the article for details.

The Duplication Elimination Prompt

When you see patterns repeated:

A code example with 14 lines - see the article for details.

The Complexity Reduction Prompt

When code is too nested:

A code example with 12 lines - see the article for details.

The Consistency Prompt

When patterns are inconsistent:

A code example with 15 lines - see the article for details.

The Comments and Documentation Prompt

When code needs explanation:

A code example with 15 lines - see the article for details.

Refactoring With Tests As Safety Net

Always have tests before refactoring:

A code example with 12 lines - see the article for details.

The Boy Scout Rule

Leave code better than you found it:

A code example with 12 lines - see the article for details.

When NOT to Refactor

Refactoring isn’t always worth it:

Code that’s about to be deleted : Don’t polish what’s leaving

Code that never changes : If it works and you never touch it, leave it

During an incident : Fix first, refactor later

Without tests : Refactoring without tests is gambling

Ask AI:

A code example with 12 lines - see the article for details.

Tomorrow

Refactoring one service is straightforward. But what about features that span multiple services? Frontend, backend, database, external APIs. Tomorrow I’ll show you how to coordinate AI work across multiple services.

Try This Today

Find a piece of AI-generated code you’ve been avoiding

Run the code smell detection prompt

Pick one smell and fix it

You don’t have to fix everything. Start with the worst part. Make it a little better. Repeat next time you’re in the file.

Code quality is incremental. Perfect is the enemy of better.

That's it for Day 25. Join us tomorrow for Day 26. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
