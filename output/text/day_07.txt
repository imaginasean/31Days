==================================================

Welcome to Day 7 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Context Management.

It’s Tuesday. You’re building a search feature. You and Claude spent two hours yesterday setting up the database schema, discussing query optimization, and implementing the basic endpoint. Good progress.

You open a new chat today. “Continue working on the search feature.”

Claude responds: “I’d be happy to help with the search feature. What database are you using? What’s the current state of the implementation? What should the search endpoint return?”

All the context from yesterday is gone. Claude doesn’t remember the conversation. Doesn’t remember the decisions. You’re starting over.

This happens to everyone. AI conversations don’t persist. Every new chat is a blank slate. And even within a single conversation, context degrades as the chat grows longer.

Managing context is the difference between productive AI sessions and frustrating reruns.

The Context Problem

AI has two limitations that create the context problem.

No memory between conversations. When you close a chat and open a new one, everything is gone. Every decision. Every file discussed. Every pattern established. Fresh start.

Degrading attention within conversations. AI models have context windows. They can hold a certain amount of text. As your conversation grows, earlier messages get less attention. By message 50, the AI might have forgotten what you discussed in message 5.

Both problems get worse on complex features. More decisions to track. More files to reference. More context that matters.

When to Start Fresh

Sometimes you should start a new conversation. Sometimes you should continue. Knowing when to do which matters.

Start fresh when:

The conversation has gone over 30-40 messages

AI is repeating itself or contradicting earlier statements

You’re changing topics (new feature, different file, unrelated task)

AI is hallucinating things that don’t exist

Quality is noticeably declining

You’re returning after a break (next day, after lunch)

Continue when:

You’re in the middle of implementing something

The conversation is short and focused

AI is producing good results

You’re iterating on the same piece of code

Context is fresh and accurate

The default should be starting fresh more often than you think. A clean slate with good context beats a long conversation with degraded attention.

What Context to Include

When you start a new conversation (or provide a substantial update), include these categories:

1. Project Context

What are you building? What tech stack? What patterns do you use?

A code example with 5 lines - see the article for details.

This doesn’t change much. Keep it in a file you can paste.

2. Session Context

What have you been working on? What decisions have been made?

A code example with 12 lines - see the article for details.

This changes per session. Update it as you go. You can even have your AI update it for you.

3. Relevant Code

The actual code AI needs to see. Not everything. Just what’s relevant.

A code example with 5 lines - see the article for details.

AI works better when it can see the code, not just hear about it.

4. Current Task

What specifically are you trying to do right now?

A code example with 4 lines - see the article for details.

Be specific. Not “improve search” but “add fuzzy matching with pg_trgm.”

The Context Template

Here’s the template I use when starting a session:

A code example with 18 lines - see the article for details.

It takes 5 minutes to write. It saves 30 minutes of re-explaining.

Maintaining Context During Long Sessions

Even within a single conversation, context can drift. Here’s how to keep it sharp.

Summarize periodically. Every 10-15 messages, summarize where you are.

A code example with 4 lines - see the article for details.

This refreshes AI’s attention on the important points.

Reference specific decisions when relevant. Instead of “use the pattern we discussed,” say “use the cursor-based pagination pattern from message 12.”

AI can look back, but it helps to point to exactly what you mean.

Keep scope narrow. Don’t let conversations sprawl across multiple features. One feature per conversation. Start fresh for the next feature.

Explicitly close topics. When you finish something, say so.

A code example with 1 lines - see the article for details.

This signals to AI that pagination context can be deprioritized.

Handling Day-to-Day Continuity

The biggest context challenge is picking up where you left off. Tuesday’s progress needs to be available on Wednesday.

Option 1: Document as you go

Keep a running document with decisions and status. Have your agent update it at the end of each session.

A code example with 20 lines - see the article for details.

Tomorrow, paste this document into your new conversation. AI has full context immediately.

Option 2: GitHub Issues as context

If you’re using GitHub Issues (from Day 2), the issue itself provides context.

A code example with 6 lines - see the article for details.

The issue is the source of truth. Your context update is just current status.

Option 3: Let AI help rebuild context

At the start of a new session:

A code example with 10 lines - see the article for details.

AI reads your code and reconstructs the context. You verify it understood correctly. Then you continue.

This is slower but useful when you don’t have documentation.

Context for Different Scenarios

Scenario: Continuing yesterday’s work

A code example with 14 lines - see the article for details.

Scenario: Starting a new feature

A code example with 13 lines - see the article for details.

Scenario: Debugging a problem

A code example with 15 lines - see the article for details.

Scenario: Code review

A code example with 14 lines - see the article for details.

Red Flags That Context Is Lost

Watch for these signs that AI has lost context:

Asking questions you already answered

Using different variable names than established

Suggesting patterns that contradict earlier decisions

Generating code that doesn’t match your tech stack

Confidently describing code that doesn’t exist

When you see these, don’t keep going. Either refresh context with a summary or start a new conversation.

The 30-Message Rule

As a rough guideline: consider starting fresh after 30 messages.

This isn’t a hard rule. Some conversations stay coherent for 50+ messages. Some drift after 15. But 30 is a useful checkpoint.

At message 30, ask yourself:

Is AI still tracking the full context?

Are responses as good as they were at the start?

Would a fresh start with good context be clearer?

Usually the answer is yes, start fresh.

Building Your Context Habit

Context management isn’t exciting. It feels like overhead. But it’s the difference between productive AI sessions and frustrating ones.

Here’s the habit:

Start every session with context. Even if it takes 5 minutes to write. Especially if it takes 5 minutes to write.

Document decisions as you make them. Not after. During. Keep a running log.

Summarize before stepping away. End of day. Before lunch. Before a meeting. Capture where you are.

Start fresh more often. When in doubt, new conversation with good context.

Let AI help. Ask AI to summarize, to read files, to verify understanding.

The goal is never losing the thread. Never starting from scratch. Always being able to pick up exactly where you left off.

Week 1 Complete

You’ve made it through the first week.

Day 1: What vibe coding is and why it works.

Day 2: Using GitHub Issues as your AI’s product backlog.

Day 3: Component libraries that teach AI your design system.

Day 4: Observability first, so you know when AI code breaks.

Day 5: The five-part prompting pattern that gets results.

Day 6: Breaking features into phases for incremental delivery.

Day 7: Managing context across sessions.

These are the fundamentals. The foundation for everything that follows.

Next week, we go tactical. What to do when AI goes down a rabbit hole. Using Git as your undo button. Agent configuration that encodes your standards. Teaching AI your patterns through examples.

The foundation is set. Now we build on it.

Try This Today

Create a context template for your project. Include:

Project context (tech stack, patterns, key files)

Session context template (current work, decisions, status)

Relevant files section (what to paste for different features)

Save it somewhere accessible. Use it to start your next AI session.

Notice how much smoother the conversation goes when AI has context from the start.

That’s the power of managing context deliberately instead of hoping AI figures it out.

That's it for Day 7. Join us tomorrow for Day 8. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
