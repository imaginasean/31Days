==================================================

Welcome to Day 24 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Deployment Automation: Let AI Generate the Scary Parts.

Migrations are scary.

Not the code. The code is usually simple. It’s the stakes. Migrations run once. They touch production data. They can’t always be undone. Get it wrong, and you’re in trouble.

Deployment scripts, rollback procedures, runbooks. Same story. You write them hoping you’ll never need them. You don’t test them because testing them is almost as scary as needing them.

This is exactly the kind of work AI should help with. Not because AI writes perfect deployment scripts, but because AI writes first drafts that include the things you’d forget. Rollback steps. Verification queries. The edge cases that bite you when you’re already stressed.

Having something to review beats staring at a blank file wondering what you’re forgetting.

The Migration Generation Prompt

For database migrations:

Showing a prompt template that instructs an AI to generate database migrations with forward, rollback, and data migration steps while considering production concerns like table locks and downtime.

A Real Migration Example

I needed to add a status field to a trades table with millions of rows.

My prompt:

Showing a prompt template requesting a PostgreSQL migration that adds a status enum field to a large trades table with zero-downtime requirements.

AI generated:

Showing a PostgreSQL migration that adds a trade status enum column with batched backfilling to avoid table locks during the update.

The AI knew about batched updates, SKIP LOCKED , and the order of operations. Things I might have gotten wrong writing it myself.

The Rollback Script Prompt

For any deployment:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to generate a deployment rollback script with verification steps, timing estimates, and stakeholder notifications.

The Deployment Checklist Prompt

For complex deployments:

Showing a prompt template that generates a comprehensive deployment checklist covering pre-deployment tasks, deployment steps, post-deployment verification, and rollback triggers for a given feature.

The Runbook Prompt

For when things go wrong:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to generate a production incident runbook with sections for failure identification, mitigation, investigation, resolution, and communication.

Infrastructure as Code

When you need infrastructure:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to generate infrastructure-as-code for a specified cloud provider with security, networking, and scaling requirements.

CI slash CD Pipeline Generation

For deployment pipelines:

Showing a prompt template that instructs an AI to generate a CI slash CD pipeline configuration with specific requirements for testing, deployment stages, caching, and rollback capabilities.

The Pre-Deployment Verification Prompt

Before you deploy:

Showing a deployment readiness checklist prompt that asks an AI to help verify tests, migrations, feature flags, monitoring, and rollback plans before deploying.

The Post-Deployment Verification Prompt

After you deploy:

Showing a prompt template that asks an AI to generate deployment verification steps including smoke tests, data queries, metrics checks, and success criteria.

Feature Flag Integration

For safe rollouts:

Showing a prompt template for generating feature flag implementation with gradual rollout percentages, monitoring metrics, and cleanup procedures.

The Deployment Documentation Prompt

For the future:

Showing a prompt template for generating deployment documentation that covers technical changes, verification steps, rollback procedures, and contact information.

Tomorrow

You’ve deployed. The feature is live. But the code is messy. AI writes working code, but working doesn’t mean maintainable. Tomorrow I’ll show you how to refactor AI code from working to maintainable.

Try This Today

Think of a deployment you have coming up

Run the deployment checklist prompt

See what you forgot

The checklist you generate won’t be perfect for your organization. But it’s a starting point. Customize it, save it, reuse it.

The goal isn’t for AI to deploy for you. It’s for AI to help you not forget the boring but critical stuff.

That's it for Day 24. Join us tomorrow for Day 25. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
