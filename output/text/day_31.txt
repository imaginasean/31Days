==================================================

Welcome to Day 31 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Your Personal Vibe Coding Playbook.

You made it.

Thirty-one days of tactics, prompts, and practices. That’s a lot. Too much to use all at once. Too much to remember without a system.

Today we build your personal playbook. Not everything from this series. Just what works for you. A reference you’ll actually use. A foundation you’ll build on.

What Goes in Your Playbook

Your playbook is personal. Mine has:

CLAUDE dot md - My agent configuration

common-ai-mistakes dot md - Patterns AI gets wrong in my projects

prompts/ - Templates for common tasks

checklists/ - Pre-commit, pre-deploy, review checklists

runbooks/ - What to do when things break

Yours might be different. That’s the point. Take what works, leave what doesn’t.

Building Your CLAUDE dot md

Your agent configuration is the foundation. Here’s a template:

Showing a markdown template for documenting project configuration, including tech stack, code standards, patterns, and common commands.

Customize this for your project. Update it as you learn what AI needs to know.

Your Prompt Library

Start with these categories:

Generation Prompts

Feature implementation

API endpoint

Component

Test suite

Review Prompts

Security review

Performance review

Maintainability review

Debug Prompts

Production issue

Log analysis

Stack trace analysis

Maintenance Prompts

Refactoring

Documentation

Debt inventory

You don’t need dozens. Start with one prompt per category. Add more as you discover what you use repeatedly.

Your Mistakes File

Create common-ai-mistakes dot md and add to it:

Showing a Markdown template structure for documenting common AI mistakes with fields for category, mistake name, the problematic AI behavior, the preferred approach, and an explanation.

Start empty. Every time you correct AI twice for the same thing, add it.

Your Checklists

Pre-Commit Checklist

Showing a checklist of code review items including tests, linting, debug code removal, security, types, and error handling.

Pre-Deploy Checklist

Showing a deployment checklist with checkboxes covering tests, migrations, rollback plans, monitoring, and team notifications.

Code Review Checklist

Showing a checklist with unchecked items for security, performance, edge cases, tests, and pattern consistency reviews.

Your Workflow

Document your AI workflow:

Feature Development

Write GitHub issue with full context

Review architecture with AI

Define contracts slash interfaces

Generate implementation

Generate tests

Run multi-pass review

Refactor as needed

Deploy with checklist

Bug Fixing

Gather symptoms and logs

Hypothesis with AI

Add logging if needed

Test hypothesis

Fix and test

Add regression test

Debugging

Describe symptom to AI

Get list of likely causes

Check each systematically

Confirm root cause

Generate fix

Verify fix

Principles to Remember

From this series, the principles that matter most:

1. You’re the architect AI is your junior developer. You make the decisions. AI helps you implement them faster.

2. Observability is non-negotiable When shipping fast, you need to know when things break. Logs, metrics, traces. Always.

3. Context is everything Better prompts get better results. Include what AI needs to know. Structure your prompts.

4. Trust but verify AI makes mistakes. Review output. Run tests. Check edge cases. Don’t assume it’s right.

5. Small steps, frequent verification Break big features into phases. Verify each phase works before continuing.

6. Document what you learn Add to your mistakes file. Update your prompts. Evolve your configuration. Learning compounds.

What’s Next

The series is over. Your journey continues.

Keep learning: AI tools evolve rapidly. What doesn’t work today might work next month. Stay curious.

Keep measuring: Track whether AI helps. Adjust based on evidence.

Keep sharing: When you find something that works, share it. The community benefits from collective learning.

Keep shipping: The point isn’t to use AI. The point is to build things that matter. AI is just a tool. Use it when it helps. Skip it when it doesn’t.

The Final Challenge

Build something.

Not a todo app. Not a tutorial project. Something real. Something you’ll use. Something you’ll show people.

Use what you’ve learned:

Plan with AI

Generate with AI

Review with AI

Test with AI

Deploy with your checklists

Monitor with observability

Ship it. Then tell me about it.

Thank You

If you’ve followed along for all 31 days, thank you. I hope you ship faster and with more confidence.

Vibe coding isn’t about AI doing your work. It’s about you doing better work with AI’s help. Stay in flow. Trust your judgment. Keep the AI as your assistant, not your replacement.

Now go build something.

Your Playbook Checklist

Before you close this series:

Showing a checklist of setup tasks for getting started with AI-assisted development, including creating documentation files and templates.

You don’t need everything. You need something. Start there. Add more as you go.

The best playbook is the one you’ll actually use.

Congratulations! You've completed 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Thanks for listening to the entire series. Now go build something amazing with AI.
