Welcome to Day 3 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Keeping Your UI Consistent.

I asked Claude to build a user settings page.

It gave me this:

Showing a simple HTML settings form with email and password input fields and a save button.

Technically correct. Functionally useless. This looks nothing like my application. The colors are wrong. The spacing is wrong. The form inputs are plain HTML instead of my custom form components. The button is a basic browser button instead of my primary action button.

This is every developer’s experience asking AI to build UI. You get something that works in isolation but looks like it came from a different application.

Here’s what I learned. AI doesn’t know what your design system looks like unless you show it.

The Problem: AI Generates Generic UI

AI is trained on thousands of public code repositories. When you ask for a form, it gives you what most forms look like across the internet. Generic HTML. Basic styling. Standard patterns.

That’s not what you need. You need UI that matches your application. Your colors. Your spacing. Your component library. Your design system.

The first time I shipped AI-generated UI to production, I spent more time fixing the styling than I would have spent building it myself. Every component needed rework. Colors adjusted. Spacing fixed. Custom components swapped in for generic HTML.

I was using AI to write code, then immediately rewriting the code AI wrote. That’s not productivity. That’s just extra steps.

The Solution: Build a Component Library AI Can Reference

Here’s the fix. Create a reference component library that shows AI exactly what good looks like in your application.

Not documentation. Not a design system PDF. Actual code that AI can read and replicate.

I created a single file to manage my design system . (Seriously, click that link. It’s worth a look.) It’s not part of my application, but I did let it ship to production so I could share it with you. It’s purely for AI to reference. ( See the source code here. )

It includes all of the elements I might use on a page:

A table for viewing cards

A table for viewing your collection.

Card elements to show players, teams, and sets in a concise way.

Different header elements

Buttons, and colors, and icons, oh my!

One of my proudest creations: the “team circle.” It’s an element to show a team without using any of the copyrighted images that are generally associated with a team. They’re used everywhere.

How to Use the Reference Library

When you ask AI to build UI, include this in your prompt:

Showing a prompt template that instructs an AI to build a user profile page using existing design system components.

AI reads your reference file. Sees your components. Understands your patterns. Generates UI that matches.

The Prompt Templates That Work

Template 1: Building with Existing Components

Showing a prompt template that instructs an AI to build a feature using only existing design system components, spacing patterns, and color tokens.

Template 2: Creating a New Component That Matches

Sometimes you need a component that doesn’t exist yet. AI should create it in the same style.

Showing a prompt template that instructs an AI to create new components following an existing design system's patterns, tokens, and conventions.

Template 3: Auditing UI Against the Component Library

You have existing UI that doesn’t match your design system. Ask AI to audit it.

Showing a prompt template that instructs an AI to audit a component against a design system reference, checking for hard-coded values and inconsistent patterns.

Real Example: Building a Dashboard

I needed a dashboard with stats cards, a chart, and a recent activity list. Here’s what I asked:

Showing a prompt template that instructs an AI to build a dashboard page using specific components and patterns from an existing design system.

AI generated this:

Showing a React dashboard component with stat cards displaying metrics like users and revenue, a chart placeholder, and a recent activity feed.

Perfect. Same card style as the rest of my app. Same spacing. Same typography. Same color usage for positive and negative metrics. Same layout pattern.

Zero time spent fixing styling.

When AI Creates Something New

Sometimes AI needs to create a component that doesn’t exist in your reference library. That’s fine. Just tell it to match the pattern.

I asked AI to build a toast notification system. I don’t have toast notifications in my reference library.

My prompt:

Showing a prompt that instructs an AI to create a toast notification component following an existing design system's patterns for colors, spacing, and component structure.

AI created a toast component that looks native to my application. Same colors. Same spacing. Same styling patterns. It fits perfectly because AI understood the pattern.

Maintaining the Reference Library

Your reference library isn’t static. When you add new components or patterns, add them to the reference file.

I update mine every time:

I create a new reusable component

I establish a new pattern

I change design tokens

I find AI consistently getting something wrong

The reference library grows with your application. It’s living documentation that AI actually uses.

Why This Works Better Than Documentation

I tried writing design system documentation for AI. A markdown file explaining our colors, spacing, component usage.

AI ignored it.

Not intentionally. It’s just that documentation describes things. Code shows things. AI is better at reading code than reading prose.

When I switched to a reference component file with actual code, AI started generating consistent UI immediately. It could see exactly what components look like. Copy the patterns. Match the style.

Code is the documentation.

What About Design Tools?

If you use Figma or similar tools, you might have a design system there. That’s great for designers.

While AI can read Figma files, you’re asking it to translate that to the HTML you want. If you have raw HTML examples for your agent to work from, you no longer need to rely on that translation.

Your reference component library is your design system translated into the format AI understands. It’s the bridge between your design system and AI-generated code.

The Difference This Makes

Before I had a reference library, every AI-generated UI component needed rework. Buttons were wrong. Colors were off. Spacing was inconsistent. Forms didn’t match.

I was spending 30-40% of my time fixing styling on AI-generated code.

After creating the reference library, AI gets it right the first time. Maybe 5% of components need minor tweaks. Usually because I didn’t specify something clearly enough.

That’s a 6x improvement in time saved.

More importantly, my application looks consistent. Every page, every component, every interaction follows the same patterns. Because AI is following the same reference I gave it.

Tomorrow

You have a component library that makes AI-generated UI look right. But looking right isn’t enough. You need to know it works right.

Tomorrow I’ll show you how to instrument AI-generated code with observability from the start. The logs, metrics, and traces that tell you whether your code is actually working in production. Because shipping fast is worthless if you don’t know what you shipped is broken.

Try This Today

Create a reference component file for your project. Start simple:

Create /design-system (or whatever fits your tech stack)

Add your color tokens with usage comments

Add your 3-5 most common components (Button, Input, Card, etc)

Add one layout pattern

Add comments showing when to use each pattern

Then ask AI to build something simple using that reference. A form. A settings page. A card list.

Watch how much better the output matches your application.

That's it for Day 3. Join us tomorrow for Day 4. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
