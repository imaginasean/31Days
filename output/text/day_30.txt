Welcome to Day 30 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: Managing Technical Debt When Shipping Fast.

The code worked. The code was a mess.

AI had generated features at unprecedented speed. Two months in, I had a product. I also had a codebase that scared me. Inconsistent patterns. Functions doing too much. Tests that passed but didn’t actually test anything. Comments that lied about what the code did.

I’d traded velocity for debt. Now the debt was coming due.

This is the dark side of vibe coding. Speed is addictive. Debt accumulates silently. Then one day you try to add a simple feature and it takes three days because everything is tangled.

Managing debt isn’t about not having debt. It’s about having the right amount of debt and paying it down strategically.

Why AI Code Accumulates Debt Faster

AI code has specific debt patterns:

Inconsistency: Each generation might use slightly different patterns. Small inconsistencies compound into chaos.

Over-engineering: AI often generates more than you need. That extra code is debt you maintain forever.

Shallow testing: AI writes tests that pass, but don’t actually verify behavior. You think you have coverage. You don’t.

Missing context: AI doesn’t know why past decisions were made. It might undo intentional choices.

Copy-paste sprawl: It’s easy to generate similar code instead of abstracting. Duplication is debt.

The Debt Inventory Prompt

Start by knowing what you have:

A code example with 17 lines - see the article for details.

Prioritizing Debt

Not all debt is equal. Prioritize by:

Impact on velocity: Does this debt slow down every feature? Fix it.

Risk: Could this debt cause production issues? Fix it soon.

Compounding: Will this debt get worse over time? Address before it spreads.

Effort: How hard is it to fix? Sometimes quick wins are worth doing.

A code example with 1 lines - see the article for details.

High impact, high risk, compounding, low effort = fix immediately.

Low impact, low risk, isolated, high effort = maybe never.

The 20% Rule

Reserve 20% of your time for debt reduction.

Every week, every sprint, every cycle: 20% goes to making the codebase better.

4 days on features, 1 day on debt

4 features, 1 cleanup task

Every PR improves one thing beyond its scope

This isn’t optional. It’s investment. Skip it, and velocity drops over time.

AI-Assisted Debt Paydown

Use AI to fix what AI created:

Pattern Consolidation

A code example with 8 lines - see the article for details.

Test Improvement

A code example with 11 lines - see the article for details.

Documentation Generation

A code example with 9 lines - see the article for details.

The Debt Log

Track debt explicitly:

A code example with 20 lines - see the article for details.

Review this log weekly. Move items up as they become urgent.

Prevention Strategies

Better to not create debt than to pay it down:

Pre-Generation Review

Before asking AI to generate significant code:

A code example with 7 lines - see the article for details.

Post-Generation Cleanup

After AI generates code, before committing:

A code example with 12 lines - see the article for details.

The PR Checklist

Before every merge:

A code example with 7 lines - see the article for details.

Debt Sprints

Sometimes you need focused cleanup:

Every quarter, schedule a debt sprint. One week focused entirely on debt reduction.

No new features

Only cleanup, consolidation, testing, documentation

Measure: lines deleted, patterns consolidated, test coverage increased

One week of cleanup buys months of velocity.

The Strangler Pattern for Legacy AI Code

When you have AI-generated code that needs major improvement:

Don’t rewrite all at once

Build new code correctly alongside old

Route new features to new code

Gradually migrate old features

Delete old code when nothing uses it

AI can help:

Signs You Have Too Much Debt

Features take longer and longer

Every change breaks something unrelated

New developers can’t understand the code

You avoid touching certain areas

Tests pass but production breaks

Simple bugs take hours to fix

When you see these signs, stop features and pay down debt.

Tomorrow

Final day. You’ve learned tactics for AI-assisted development. Tomorrow we’ll build your personal playbook: the practices you’ll keep, the workflow you’ll use, the principles that guide your vibe coding.

Try This Today

Pick one area of your codebase that scares you

Run the debt inventory prompt on it

Fix one thing. Just one.

Small, consistent debt payment beats occasional massive rewrites. Start today. Continue tomorrow. In a month, the scary area is manageable.

Debt is normal. Unmanaged debt is the problem.

That's it for Day 30. Join us tomorrow for Day 31. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
