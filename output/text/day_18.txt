==================================================

Welcome to Day 18 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: AI as Test Generator.

I used to skip tests.

Not intentionally. But when AI generates a feature in 10 minutes, spending an hour writing tests feels backwards. The feature works. I tested it manually. Ship it.

Then the bugs started. Edge cases I didn’t think to test. Regressions when I changed something else. The “it worked on my machine” problems that only appeared in production.

Now AI writes my tests too. The same tool that generates the feature generates the tests that verify it. Often AI thinks of edge cases I wouldn’t have considered. Empty arrays. Null values. Unicode characters. Concurrent access.

The trick is knowing how to ask.

Why AI-Generated Tests Are Different

When you write tests manually, you test what you thought about. When AI writes tests, it tests what the code does. These aren’t the same thing.

You might forget to test the empty array case. AI sees the code handles arrays and generates tests for empty, one element, many elements.

You might not think about Unicode. AI sees string handling and tests with emoji, special characters, different alphabets.

The limitation: AI also doesn’t know your business logic. It tests what the code does, not what the code should do. You need to guide it.

The Basic Test Generation Prompt

Here’s the prompt that generates useful tests:

A code example with 19 lines - see the article for details.

A Real Example

Here’s a function AI generated:

A code example with 30 lines - see the article for details.

Here’s what AI generated for tests:

A code example with 100 lines - see the article for details.

Notice what AI caught: transfer to self, special characters, SQL injection attempts, empty strings. These are edge cases I might not have written manually.

The Edge Case Prompt

When you want AI to dig deeper on edge cases:

A code example with 18 lines - see the article for details.

Integration Test Generation

Unit tests verify functions. Integration tests verify flows:

A code example with 19 lines - see the article for details.

API Endpoint Tests

For REST APIs, be specific about what to test:

A code example with 19 lines - see the article for details.

The Test Pyramid Prompt

Different levels of testing catch different problems:

A code example with 22 lines - see the article for details.

When AI Tests Go Wrong

AI-generated tests have failure modes:

Testing implementation, not behavior:

A code example with 5 lines - see the article for details.

Tautological tests:

A code example with 5 lines - see the article for details.

Missing assertions:

A code example with 5 lines - see the article for details.

Tell AI to avoid these:

A code example with 5 lines - see the article for details.

Coverage-Focused Generation

When you need to hit coverage targets:

A code example with 14 lines - see the article for details.

Testing AI Code vs Manual Code

AI code often needs more tests than code you write yourself. Why?

You understand the code you write. You know the edge cases because you thought through them while writing. AI code is a black box. You need tests to understand what it actually does.

My rule: if AI wrote it, it needs twice the test coverage I’d write for my own code.

Test Maintenance

AI generates tests, but you maintain them. Make them maintainable:

A code example with 15 lines - see the article for details.

Tomorrow

You’ve generated tests. But who reviews the code? Manual code review is slow. AI can do multiple review passes faster than you can do one.

Tomorrow I’ll show you how to use AI as a code reviewer. Multiple passes, different focuses, comprehensive feedback.

Try This Today

Take a function AI generated recently

Ask AI to generate tests for it

Run the tests

See if any fail

Failing tests from AI-generated test suites often reveal bugs in AI-generated code. The same tool that created the bug might write the test that catches it.

That’s not irony. That’s leverage.

That's it for Day 18. Join us tomorrow for Day 19. Thanks for listening to 31 Days of Vibe Coding.
