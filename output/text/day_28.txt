Welcome to Day 28 of 31 Days of Vibe Coding. Today's topic is: The AI Tool Landscape: When to Use What.

I use four different AI tools.

Not because I can’t pick one. Because different tools are better at different things. Claude Code for codebase-wide changes. GitHub Copilot for inline completions. ChatGPT for exploring ideas. Cursor when I want AI deeply integrated in my editor.

The tool landscape is confusing. Marketing makes everything sound the same. In practice, they’re different in ways that matter.

Here’s my honest assessment of when to use what.

Claude Code

Best for: Codebase-wide operations, multi-file changes, complex reasoning

Claude Code operates across your entire repository. It can read multiple files, understand relationships, and make coordinated changes. When you need to refactor a pattern that appears in 20 files, Claude Code handles it.

Use it when:

Changes span multiple files

You need to understand how components relate

Complex reasoning about architecture

Large refactoring operations

You want AI to read existing patterns and follow them

Skip it when:

Quick inline completions

You just need a one-liner

Exploring ideas before you know what you want

Strengths: Deep codebase understanding, multi-file coordination, detailed reasoning, long context window

Weaknesses: Setup required, can be slower for quick tasks, costs more for heavy use

GitHub Copilot

Best for: Inline completions, quick suggestions while typing

Copilot lives in your editor. As you type, it suggests completions. It’s fast and low-friction. Write a function signature, Copilot suggests the body. Write a comment, Copilot suggests the code.

Use it when:

Writing code line by line

Boilerplate that follows patterns

Test cases similar to existing ones

Obvious implementations

You know what you want, just need it typed faster

Skip it when:

Complex multi-file changes

You need to understand before generating

Architecture decisions

Code review

Strengths: Speed, low friction, IDE integration, learns your patterns

Weaknesses: No reasoning shown, limited to local context, sometimes suggests wrong patterns

ChatGPT / Claude Web

Best for: Exploration, planning, learning, one-off questions

The web interfaces are for thinking out loud. You don’t need file access. You want to explore an idea, understand a concept, plan an approach before committing.

Use it when:

“How should I approach this?”

“Explain this concept”

“What are the tradeoffs between X and Y?”

Planning before implementing

Quick questions unrelated to specific code

Skip it when:

You need to work with actual files

Multi-file changes

Generating production code

Strengths: Easy access, no setup, good for conversation, multiple models available

Weaknesses: Can’t see your code, copy-paste friction, context lost between sessions

Cursor

Best for: AI-native editing, tight editor integration

Cursor is an IDE built around AI. It has Claude and GPT built in, with deep integration for editing, chat, and code generation. If you want AI to be central to your editing experience, Cursor makes it seamless.

Use it when:

You want AI always available in your editor

Editing and generation in one flow

You prefer IDE over CLI

Your workflow is file-by-file with AI help

Skip it when:

Large codebase-wide operations

You’re happy with your current editor

You want to keep AI separate from editing

Strengths: Seamless integration, fast iteration, good UX for AI-assisted editing

Weaknesses: Another IDE to learn, subscription cost, less control than CLI

Windsurf / Codeium

Best for: Free alternative, team environments

Codeium and Windsurf offer AI coding tools with generous free tiers. Good for teams that can’t justify per-seat costs or developers who want to try AI coding without commitment.

Use it when:

Budget constraints

Evaluating AI tools

Team rollout with cost concerns

Strengths: Free tier, team features, good performance

Weaknesses: Less cutting-edge than premium options, smaller context windows

Aider

Best for: Terminal-native workflows, Git integration

Aider is a command-line tool that integrates AI with Git. Every AI change becomes a commit. It’s great if you live in the terminal and want version control built into AI interactions.

Use it when:

You prefer terminal over IDE

You want every AI change as a Git commit

You’re working on specific files, not exploring

Skip it when:

You want visual UI

You’re exploring broad changes

Strengths: Git integration, terminal-native, supports multiple AI models

Weaknesses: Learning curve, less visual feedback

My Daily Workflow

Here’s how I actually use these tools:

Morning planning: ChatGPT or Claude web for thinking through what I’m building. “Here’s what I want to accomplish. What’s the approach?”

Implementation: Claude Code for features that touch multiple files. Copilot for inline completions while I type. Switch between them based on task size.

Quick fixes: Copilot for obvious one-liners. Claude Code if I need to find where the fix should go.

Code review: Claude Code for multi-pass reviews. It can read the whole codebase and spot inconsistencies.

Debugging: Claude Code for systematic debugging with code access. ChatGPT for quick “why might this happen?” questions.

Choosing Based on Task

The Integration Question

Some developers use one tool for everything. Others use multiple tools for different purposes.

Single tool advantages:

Simpler workflow

One subscription

Consistent experience

Context accumulates

Multiple tool advantages:

Best tool for each job

Redundancy if one is down

Compare outputs

Different strengths

I lean toward multiple tools because the differences matter for my work. But simpler is also valid.

Cost Considerations

AI tools range from free to expensive. I use ChatGPT Pro ($20), Claude Code Max ($100), and GitHub Copilot from my employer.

For professional use, the cost is usually justified by time saved. For learning or light use, free tiers work fine.

What to Try First

If you’re starting:

GitHub Copilot for inline completions (easiest start)

Claude or ChatGPT web for exploration and planning

Claude Code when you’re ready for codebase-wide AI

Add more tools as you discover specific needs they fill.

Tomorrow

You’re using AI tools. But how do you know they’re actually helping? Tomorrow I’ll cover measuring what matters: tracking whether AI is making you faster, or just making you feel faster.

Try This Today

Think about your last few AI interactions

Which tool did you use?

Was it the best tool for that task?

If you’re using one tool for everything, try another for the task it’s best at. You might find a combination that works better than any single tool.
